    <h2>Statement</h2>
    <p>I work primarily with photography as my medium, exploring the convergence of human emotions, traumatic memories, and bodily sensations. My research is informed by psychoanalytic theories, delving deep into the connection between our inner worlds and the external physicality of the universe.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am an art graduate student specializing in Media Art Design, and I am also an artist-in-residence at Cité internationale des arts in Paris. While my base is in Nagoya, Japan, I am currently living and working in Paris as part of this residency.</p>
